<p class="p3"><span class="s2">My name is Ben. I love reading (and writing) about all things sports, math, and technology. Right now, I'm studying computer science at Waterloo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.9px 0.0px; line-height: 22.0px; font: 18.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s2"><b>More about me</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I'm going into my fourth year at the University of Waterloo for Computer Science (graduating in 2021). I've worked in a fairly diverse set of roles: I've been a full-stack web dev, a data scientist and a data engineer. (Oh, and I was planning on being an actuary before switching to CS). I like writing code all over the stack and learning about new tech.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A big part of my life outside of work revolves around sports. For the past two years, I've mainly been playing ultimate, both on Waterloo's club team as well as on a London-based touring team. I was also able to play with NYU's team while interning in NYC. Here's the only filmed game I've ever played in: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFa_-HfAkCQ"><span class="s3">CUUC 2019 game to go to Division 1</span></a>. Besides ultimate, I continue to play hockey, and during high school I also played soccer, baseball and swam for the school's team.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Before coming to university, I lived in Doha, Qatar for six years. Doha is very centrally located and I was able to travel a lot while I was there: between sports tournaments, service trips and family vacations, I've visited 25 countries. I've also lived in New York for a total of eight months while on internships.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In my free time, I like to write articles. I've published some on <a href="https://medium.com/@nicklemoing"><span class="s3">Medium</span></a> but I'm planning on transitioning everything to my <a href="file:///blog"><span class="s3">blog</span></a> from now on so I can customize them a bit more. The only common theme shared by the articles is "Things Nick Finds Interesting and Will Sink Too Much Time Into". Hopefully you find them interesting too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
